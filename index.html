    <h1>My favorite hobby <br> Reading</h1>
    <div id="line"></div>
    <p>My favorite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading newspapers, encyclopedias and mystery stories. Presently I am reading the Percy Jackson series. I liked reading since I was in 4th standard. Best thing about reading is you can do it all by yourself without forcing anyone to join you. I can sit for hours with my book without getting bored. When I start reading it is like I get into another world. Reading improves your imagination, sence of humour and knowledge. I would recommend reading to everybody. </p>
